![Dashboard - Google Chrome 2022-12-08 13-25-30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51708585/206452904-09deccef-5eca-4dac-8126-ad89ea281dbe.gif)


### My Input to ChatGPT:
react typescript application that displays a dashboard. Do not pass anything in props but store everything in a Zustand store using Immer, with all actions implemented. Fetch and parse a json from "dashboard.ashx" to fill the store. In the dashboard, there is a banner with a title and a list of buttons, having an icon and a label, and an id. Below the banner, there is a flexbox panelList which is a list of panels. Each panel of the panellist contains a list of components. A component can be a counter or a report. The counters display a value in a color and a subvalue with a smaller font. The reports use Highcharts. Each report fetch its data from "report.ashx" adding their id in the fetch url. Use react-dnd to move the components across the panels.  Create a mirage test server to handle the requests. Give me the list of files of the application.

Here is a list of the files that would be part of a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

package.json - this file would contain the dependencies and scripts for the application.

tsconfig.json - this file would contain the TypeScript configuration for the project.

index.tsx - this is the entry point for the application, where the React application would be rendered.

App.tsx - this is the root component for the application, where the dashboard would be rendered.

Dashboard.tsx - this is the component that would render the dashboard, including the banner with the title and list of buttons, and the panelList with the panels and components.

Banner.tsx - this is the component that would render the banner with the title and list of buttons.

Button.tsx - this is the component that would render a single button in the banner.

PanelList.tsx - this is the component that would render the list of panels in the dashboard.

Panel.tsx - this is the component that would render a single panel in the panelList, including the list of components.

Counter.tsx - this is the component that would render a counter component in a panel, displaying a value and subvalue.

Report.tsx - this is the component that would render a report component in a panel, using Highcharts to display the data.

data.ts - this file would contain the data model for the application, including interfaces for the dashboard, panels, components, and fetched data.

store.ts - this file would contain the logic for the Zustand store, including the initial state, actions, and selectors for the data.

api.ts - this file would contain the logic for fetching data from the "dashboard.ashx" and "report.ashx" endpoints.

server.ts - this file would contain the logic for the Mirage test server, which would handle requests to the endpoints and return mocked data.

tests.ts - this file would contain the unit tests for the application, including tests for the components and the store logic.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of panellist.tsx

Here is an example of what the PanelList.tsx component could look like in a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'zustand';
import { Panel } from './Panel';
import { Panel as PanelData } from './data';

export const PanelList: React.FC = () => {
  const panels = useSelector((state) => state.panels);

  return (
    <div className="panel-list">
      {panels.map((panel: PanelData) => (
        <Panel key={panel.id} panel={panel} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```
The PanelList component is a functional component that uses the useSelector hook from Zustand to access the list of panels from the store. It then renders a Panel component for each panel in the list, passing the panel data as a prop. The PanelList component is wrapped in a div element with the panel-list class.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of package.json

Here is an example of what the package.json file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```
{
  "name": "dashboard-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard.",
  "main": "index.tsx",

    "@testing-library/user-event": "^12.1.10",
    "miragejs": "^2.0.0"
  }
}
```
The package.json file contains the dependencies and scripts for the application. It includes the core React libraries, as well as dependencies for Zustand, Immer, Highcharts, react-dnd, and TypeScript. It also includes dev dependencies for testing libraries and MirageJS. The scripts section includes commands for starting the development server, building the application for production, running tests, and ejecting the configuration.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of tsconfig.json

Here is an example of what the tsconfig.json file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "jsx": "react",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["src"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
The tsconfig.json file contains the TypeScript configuration for the project. It specifies the compiler options, including the target language version, module type, and JSX handling. It also includes the src directory in the list of files to compile, and excludes the node_modules directory. This configuration ensures that the TypeScript compiler will transpile the code in the src directory to ES6 JavaScript, using the commonjs module system and React JSX syntax. It also enables strict type checking and interoperability with other JavaScript modules.
```



### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of index.tsx

Here is an example of what the index.tsx file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { App } from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
The index.tsx file is the entry point for the application, where the React application is rendered. It imports the App component from the App.tsx file, and then uses the ReactDOM.render method to render the App component inside the element with the root id in the HTML document. This will initialize the React application and display the dashboard.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of App.tsx

Here is an example of what the App.tsx file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Dashboard } from './Dashboard';

export const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="app">
      <Dashboard />
    </div>
  );
};
```
The App component is a functional component that returns the Dashboard component inside a div element with the app class. The App component is the root component for the application, and all other components will be rendered inside it. The Dashboard component is responsible for rendering the actual dashboard, including the banner, panelList, and components.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of Dashboard.tsxc

Here is an example of what the Dashboard.tsx file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'zustand';
import { Banner } from './Banner';
import { PanelList } from './PanelList';
import { fetchDashboardData } from './api';

export const Dashboard: React.FC = () => {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const dashboard = useSelector((state) => state.dashboard);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchDashboardData().then((data) => dispatch(setDashboardData(data)));
  }, [dispatch]);

  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <Banner title={dashboard.title} buttons={dashboard.buttons} />
      <PanelList />
    </div>
  );
};
```
The Dashboard component is a functional component that uses the useDispatch and useSelector hooks from Zustand to access the store and dispatch actions. It uses the useEffect hook to fetch the dashboard data from the "dashboard.ashx" endpoint when the component is first rendered. The fetchDashboardData function is imported from the api.ts file and returns a promise with the dashboard data. When the promise is resolved, the setDashboardData action is dispatched with the data, which updates the store and triggers a re-render of the Dashboard component.

The Dashboard component then renders the Banner component with the title and buttons from the dashboard data, and the PanelList component to render the list of panels. The Dashboard component is wrapped in a div element with the dashboard class.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of Banner.tsx

Here is an example of what the Banner.tsx file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from './Button';
import { Button as ButtonData } from './data';

interface Props {
  title: string;
  buttons: ButtonData[];
}

export const Banner: React.FC<Props> = ({ title, buttons }) => {
  return (
    <div className="banner">
      <h1 className="banner-title">{title}</h1>
      <div className="banner-buttons">
        {buttons.map((button) => (
          <Button key={button.id} button={button} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
The Banner component is a functional component that accepts the title and buttons props. It renders the title inside an h1 element with the banner-title class, and a div element with the banner-buttons class containing a Button component for each button in the buttons prop. The Button component is imported from the Button.tsx file and rendered with the button prop, which contains the data for a single button. The Banner component is wrapped in a div element with the banner class.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of Button.tsx

Here is an example of what the Button.tsx file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { Button as ButtonData } from './data';

interface Props {
  button: ButtonData;
}

export const Button: React.FC<Props> = ({ button }) => {
  return (
    <button className="banner-button" id={button.id}>
      <i className={`icon-${button.icon}`} />
      {button.label}
    </button>
  );
};
```
The Button component is a functional component that accepts the button prop, which contains the data for a single button. It renders a button element with the banner-button class and the id from the button data. Inside the button element, it renders an i element with a class based on the icon from the button data, and the label from the button data. This will display an icon and label for the button.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of PanelList.tsx

Here is an example of what the PanelList.tsx file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useSelector } from 'zustand';
import { Panel } from './Panel';
import { Panel as PanelData } from './data';

export const PanelList: React.FC = () => {
  const panels = useSelector((state) => state.panels);

  return (
    <div className="panel-list">
      {panels.map((panel: PanelData) => (
        <Panel key={panel.id} panel={panel} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

The PanelList component is a functional component that uses the useSelector hook from Zustand to access the list of panels from the store. It then renders a Panel component for each panel in the list, passing the panel data as a prop. The PanelList component is wrapped in a div element with the panel-list class.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of Panel.tsx

Here is an example of what the Panel.tsx file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useDrop } from 'react-dnd';
import { DndTypes } from './data';
import { Counter } from './Counter';
import { Report } from './Report';
import { Panel as PanelData } from './data';

interface Props {
  panel: PanelData;
}

export const Panel: React.FC<Props> = ({ panel }) => {
  const [{ isOver }, drop] = useDrop({
    accept: [DndTypes.Counter, DndTypes.Report],
    drop: () => dispatch(addComponent(panel.id)),
    collect: (monitor) => ({
      isOver: monitor.isOver()
    })
  });

  return (
    <div className="panel" ref={drop}>
      <h2 className="panel-title">{panel.title}</h2>
      <div className="panel-components">
        {panel.components.map((component) =>
          component.type === DndTypes.Counter ? (
            <Counter key={component.id} counter={component} />
          ) : (
            <Report key={component.id} report={component} />
          )
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The Panel component is a functional component that accepts the panel prop, which contains the data for a single panel. It uses the useDrop hook from react-dnd to enable dropping of counter and report components onto the panel. When a component is dropped, the addComponent action is dispatched with the panel id, which adds the component to the panel in the store. The isOver property from the hook is used to add a visual indicator when a component is being dragged over the panel.

The Panel component then renders the panel title inside an h2 element with the panel-title class, and a div element with the panel-components class containing a Counter or Report component for each component in the panel. The Counter and Report components are imported from the corresponding files and rendered with the counter or report prop, which contains the data for the component. The Panel component is wrapped in a div element with the panel class and the ref from the useDrop hook.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of Counter.tsx

Here is an example of what the Counter.tsx file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useDrag } from 'react-dnd';
import { DndTypes } from './data';
import { Counter as CounterData } from './data';

interface Props {
  counter: CounterData;
}

export const Counter: React.FC<Props> = ({ counter }) => {
  const [{ isDragging }, drag] = useDrag({
    item: { type: DndTypes.Counter, id: counter.id },
    collect: (monitor) => ({
      isDragging: monitor.isDragging()
    })
  });

  return (
    <div
      className="counter"
      ref={drag}
      style={{
        opacity: isDragging ? 0.5 : 1
      }}
    >
      <h3 className="counter-title">{counter.title}</h3>
      <div className="counter-value" style={{ color: counter.color }}>
        {counter.value}
      </div>
      <div className="counter-subvalue">{counter.subvalue}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

The Counter component is a functional component that accepts the counter prop, which contains the data for a single counter. It uses the useDrag hook from react-dnd to enable dragging of the counter component. The hook returns the isDragging property, which is used to add a visual effect when the component is being dragged.

The Counter component then renders the counter title inside an h3 element with the counter-title class, and a div element with the counter-value class and a color based on the color from the counter data. It also renders a div element with the counter-subvalue class containing the subvalue from the counter data. The Counter component is wrapped in a div element with the counter class and the ref from the useDrag hook, and the opacity is set based on the isDragging property to




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of Report.tsx

Here is an example of what the Report.tsx file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useDrag } from 'react-dnd';
import { DndTypes } from './data';
import Highcharts from 'highcharts';
import HighchartsReact from 'highcharts-react-official';
import { Report as ReportData } from './data';
import { fetchReportData } from './api';

interface Props {
  report: ReportData;
}

export const Report: React.FC<Props> = ({ report }) => {
  const [{ isDragging }, drag] = useDrag({
    item: { type: DndTypes.Report, id: report.id },
    collect: (monitor) => ({
      isDragging: monitor.isDragging()
    })
  });
  const [chartOptions, setChartOptions] = useState<Highcharts.Options>({});

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchReportData(report.id).then((data) => setChartOptions(data));
  }, [report.id]);

  return (
    <div
      className="report"
      ref={drag}
      style={{
        opacity: isDragging ? 0.5 : 1
      }}
    >
      <h3 className="report-title">{report.title}</h3>
      <HighchartsReact highcharts={Highcharts} options={chartOptions} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

The Report component is a functional component that accepts the report prop, which contains the data for a single report. It uses the useDrag hook from react-dnd to enable dragging of the report component. The hook returns the isDragging property, which is used to add a visual effect when the component is being dragged.

The Report component also uses the useState hook to store the chartOptions for the report, and the useEffect hook to fetch the data for the report from the "report.ashx" endpoint when the component is first rendered. The fetchReportData function is imported from the api.ts file and returns a promise with the chart data for the report. When the promise is resolved, the chartOptions are updated with the data, which triggers a re-render of the Report component and updates the chart.

The Report component then renders the report title inside an h3 element with the report-title class, and a HighchartsReact component with the chartOptions as the options. This will display the report as a chart using Highcharts. The Report component is wrapped in a div element with the report class and the ref from the useDrag hook, and the opacity is set based on the isDragging property to add the dragging visual effect.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of data.ts

Here is an example of what the data.ts file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
export const DndTypes = {
  Counter: 'counter',
  Report: 'report'
};

export interface Button {
  id: string;
  icon: string;
  label: string;
}

export interface Counter {
  id: string;
  type: typeof DndTypes.Counter;
  title: string;
  value: number;
  color: string;
  subvalue: string;
}

export interface Report {
  id: string;
  type: typeof DndTypes.Report;
  title: string;
}

export interface Panel {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  components: Array<Counter | Report>;
}

export interface Dashboard {
  title: string;
  buttons: Button[];
  panels: Panel[];
}
```

The data.ts file exports several interfaces that define the data structures used in the application. The DndTypes object contains the string values for the types of components that can be dragged and dropped on the dashboard. The Button, Counter, Report, and Panel interfaces define the data structures for buttons, counters, reports, and panels, respectively. The Dashboard interface defines the data structure for the dashboard, which includes the title, buttons, and panels. These interfaces are used by the components to access the data from the store and to render the data in the UI.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of store.ts

Here is an example of what the store.ts file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import produce from 'immer';
import { create } from 'zustand';
import { Dashboard as DashboardData } from './data';

const initialState: DashboardData = {
  title: '',
  buttons: [],
  panels: []
};

const [useStore] = create((set) => ({
  state: initialState,
  setState: (updater: (draft: DashboardData) => void) =>
    set((state) => produce(state, updater))
}));

const addComponent = (panelId: string) => (
  draft: DashboardData,
  component: Counter | Report
) => {
  draft.panels.find((panel) => panel.id === panelId)?.components.push(component);
};

export const useDashboardStore = () => {
  const { state, setState } = useStore();
  return {
    state,
    addComponent: (panelId: string, component: Counter | Report) =>
      setState(addComponent(panelId)(_, component))
  };
};
```

The store.ts file exports the useDashboardStore hook, which provides access to the dashboard data in the store and the addComponent action. The initialState constant is defined with the initial values for the dashboard data, and the useStore hook from Zustand is used to create the store. The addComponent action is a curried function that accepts the panelId and returns a draft updater function that pushes the provided component to the list of components in the panel with the specified panelId. The useDashboardStore hook returns the state and addComponent action from the store, which can be used by the components to access and update the data in the store.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of api.ts

Here is an example of what the api.ts file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import axios from 'axios';
import { Report as ReportData } from './data';

const fetchDashboardData = () => axios.get<Dashboard>('/dashboard.ashx');
const fetchReportData = (reportId: string) =>
  axios.get<Highcharts.Options>(`/report.ashx?id=${reportId}`);

export { fetchDashboardData, fetchReportData };
```

The api.ts file exports the fetchDashboardData and fetchReportData functions, which are used to fetch the data for the dashboard and reports from the corresponding endpoints. These functions use the axios library to make the HTTP requests and return a promise with the response data. The fetchDashboardData function fetches the data for the dashboard from the "dashboard.ashx" endpoint, and the fetchReportData function fetches the data for the report with the specified reportId from the "report.ashx" endpoint. The response data is typed using the interfaces from the data.ts file. These functions can be used by the components to fetch the data when needed, for example when the application is first rendered or when a report is added to a panel.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of server.ts

Here is an example of what the server.ts file could look like for a React TypeScript application that uses MirageJS to create a test server for the React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import { Server, Model, Factory } from 'miragejs';
import { Dashboard as DashboardData } from './data';

export function makeServer() {
  return new Server({
    models: {
      dashboard: Model
    },
    factories: {
      dashboard: Factory.extend<DashboardData>({
        title: 'Test Dashboard',
        buttons: [
          { id: '1', icon: 'icon1', label: 'Button 1' },
          { id: '2', icon: 'icon2', label: 'Button 2' }
        ],
        panels: [
          {
            id: '1',
            title: 'Panel 1',
            components: [
              {
                id: '1',
                type: DndTypes.Counter,
                title: 'Counter 1',
                value: 42,
                color: '#00ff00',
                subvalue: 'subvalue 1'
              },
              {
                id: '2',
                type: DndTypes.Report,
                title: 'Report 1'
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            id: '2',
            title: 'Panel 2',
            components: [
              {
                id: '3',
                type: DndTypes.Counter,
                title: 'Counter 2',
                value: 100,
                color: '#0000ff',
                subvalue: 'subvalue 2'
              },
              {
                id: '4',
                type: DndTypes.Report,
                title: 'Report 2'
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
```

The makeServer function creates a new Server instance from MirageJS, and defines the models, factories, and routes for the test server. The dashboard model is defined using the Factory.extend method, which creates a new factory with the initial data for the dashboard. The routes method is used to define the endpoints for the test server. The get method is used to define a GET endpoint, which returns the data for the dashboard when accessed at the "dashboard.ashx" URL and

### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of index.html

Here is an example of what the index.html file could look like for a React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>Dashboard</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```
The index.html file is the entry point for the React TypeScript application. It defines the basic structure of the HTML page, including the <title> element and the <div> element with the id attribute set to "root". The React TypeScript application will be rendered inside this <div> element. The index.html file also includes the <meta> elements that define the character set and the viewport of the page.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
content of store.Ts

Here is an example of what the store.ts file could look like for a React TypeScript application that uses Zustand and Immer to create a store for the React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import create, { SetState } from 'zustand';
import produce, { Draft } from 'immer';
import { Dashboard as DashboardData } from './data';

interface DashboardState {
  dashboard: DashboardData;
  setDashboard: SetState<DashboardData>;
}

const [useStore] = create<DashboardState>(set => ({
  dashboard: {
    title: '',
    buttons: [],
    panels: []
  },
  setDashboard: (dashboard: DashboardData) =>
    set(state =>
      produce(state, draft => {
        draft.dashboard = dashboard;
      })
    )
}));

export default useStore;
```
The store.ts file exports a function that creates a new store using the create function from Zustand. The initial state of the store is defined in the object that is passed as the argument to the create function. The initial state includes an empty dashboard object, and a setDashboard function that updates the dashboard state using the Immer produce function. The useStore hook is used to access the store in the React components.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
src/server.ts:68:30 - error TS2339: Property 'dashboard' does not exist on type 'Schema<Registry<Record<string, ModelDefinition<{}>>, Record<string, FactoryDefinition<{}>>>>'.

68         const panel = schema.dashboard.find('1')!.panels.find((panel) =>

To fix this error, you need to specify the type of the schema parameter in the routes function of the server.ts file. The schema parameter is an instance of the Schema class from MirageJS, and it represents the database for the test server. The dashboard property is defined on the Schema class, but its type is determined by the type of the models that are defined in the test server. In this case, the dashboard model is defined as a Model instance, so the dashboard property of the schema parameter will have the type Model<DashboardData>, where DashboardData is the type of the data for the dashboard model.

To fix the error, you can add a type annotation for the schema parameter in the routes function, like this:

```jsx
import { Schema } from 'miragejs';
import { DashboardData } from './data';

// ...

routes(this: Server) {
  this.namespace = 'api';

  this.get('/dashboard.ashx', () => {
    return this.db.dashboard.find('1');
  });

  this.get('/report.ashx', (schema: Schema<Model<DashboardData>>, request) => {
    const reportId = request.queryParams.id;
    const panel = schema.dashboard.find('1')!.panels.find((panel) =>
      panel.components.some((component) => component.id === reportId)
    );
    const report = panel!.components.find(
      (component) => component.id === reportId
    );

    return {
      chart: {
        type: 'bar',
        data: {
          labels: ['A', 'B', 'C'],
          datasets: [
            {
              label: report!.title,
              data: [1, 2, 3]
            }
          ]

### My Input to ChatGPT:
use makeServer in index

Here is an example of how you could use the makeServer function in the index.tsx file to create a test server for the React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import { makeServer } from './server';

const server = makeServer();
server.logging = true;
server.db.loadData({
  dashboard: [
    {
      id: '1',
      title: 'Test Dashboard',
      buttons: [
        { id: '1', icon: 'icon1', label: 'Button 1' },
        { id: '2', icon: 'icon2', label: 'Button 2' }
      ],
      panels: [
        {
          id: '1',
          title: 'Panel 1',
          components: [
            {
              id: '1',
              type: DndTypes.Counter,
              title: 'Counter 1',
              value: 42,
              color: '#00ff00',
              subvalue: 'subvalue 1'
            },
            {
              id: '2',
              type: DndTypes.Report,
              title: 'Report 1'
            }
          ]
        },
        {
          id: '2',
          title: 'Panel 2',
          components: [
            {
              id: '3',
              type: DndTypes.Counter,
              title: 'Counter 2',
              value: 100,
              color: '#0000ff',
              subvalue: 'subvalue 2'
            },
            {
              id: '4',
              type: DndTypes.Report,
              title: 'Report 2'
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
});

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```
In the index.tsx file, you can import the makeServer function from the server.ts file, and use it to create a new test server. The makeServer function returns an instance of the MirageServer class from MirageJS, which represents the test server. You can configure the test server by setting its properties, such as the logging property, and




### My Input to ChatGPT:
Uncaught Invariant Violation: Expected drag drop context

This error occurs when the React TypeScript application that uses the react-dnd library is not wrapped in a DndProvider component. The DndProvider component is provided by the react-dnd library, and it is used to wrap the React components that use the drag and drop functionality provided by react-dnd.

To fix this error, you need to wrap the top-level component of the React TypeScript application in a DndProvider component, like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { DndProvider } from 'react-dnd';
import HTML5Backend from 'react-dnd-html5-backend';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <DndProvider backend={HTML5Backend}>
    <App />
  </DndProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
In this example, the DndProvider component is imported from the react-dnd library, and it is wrapped around the App component. The DndProvider component takes a backend prop, which specifies the backend implementation to use for drag and drop operations. In this example, the HTML5Backend implementation is used, which is provided by the react-dnd-html5-backend package.

After wrapping the App component in a DndProvider component, the drag and drop functionality provided by react-dnd should work correctly, and the error should no longer occur.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
get content of css

The content of the CSS file depends on the specific styles and layout of the React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard. Here is an example of what the CSS file could look like for a simple React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard:

```css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

#root {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100vh;
}

.dashboard {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  width: 800px;
}

.banner {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-between;
  width: 100%;
}

.title {
  font-size: 24px;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.button {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 8px;
  margin: 8px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.icon {
  width: 24px;
  height: 24px;
  fill: currentColor;
}

.label {
  margin-left: 8px;
}

.panelList {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  margin: 8px;
}

.panel {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  margin: 8px;
  padding: 8px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

.panelTitle {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: bold;
  margin-bottom: 8px;
}

.component {
  margin: 8px;
  padding: 8px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

.counter {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;

.counterValue {
  font-size: 24px;
  color: #00ff00;
}

.counterSubvalue {
  font-size: 14px;
  color: #00ff00;
}

.report {
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
}

This CSS file defines the styles for the various elements of the React TypeScript application that displays a




### My Input to ChatGPT:
Import css in app

To import a CSS file in a React TypeScript application, you can use the import statement and specify the path to the CSS file, like this:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import './styles.css';

const App: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;

```
In this example, the styles.css file is imported at the top of the App component file. The import statement allows the CSS styles defined in the styles.css file to be used in the App component. You can then use the className prop on React elements to apply the styles defined in the CSS file.

After importing the CSS file, the styles defined in the file will be applied to the React elements in the App component, and the React TypeScript application will have the desired layout and styling.




### My Input to ChatGPT:
Fix the reports not showing anything

If the reports in the React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard are not showing anything, there could be several reasons for this. Here are some possible causes and solutions for this problem:

The Report component is not fetching the data from the "report.ashx" endpoint correctly. To fix this, you can check the implementation of the Report component and verify that it is using the correct URL and parameters to fetch the data for the report.

```jsx
// In the Report component
useEffect(() => {
  fetch(`report.ashx?id=${id}`)
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      // Set the data for the report
      setData(data);
    });
}, [id]);
```
The "report.ashx" endpoint is not returning the correct data for the report. To fix this, you can check the implementation of the "report.ashx" endpoint and verify that it is returning the data in the correct format for the report.

```jsx
// In the "report.ashx" endpoint
const id = request.queryParams['id'];
const reportData = database.reports.find((report) => report.id === id);

response.ok({
  title: reportData.title,
  xAxis: {
    categories: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']
  },
  series: [{
    data: reportData.data
  }]
});
```
The Highcharts library is not being used correctly in the Report component. To fix this, you can check the implementation of the Report component and verify that it is using the Highcharts library correctly to render the report data.

```jsx
// In the Report component
const [chart, setChart] = useState<Highcharts.Chart>();

useEffect(() => {
  if (chart) {
    // Update the chart with the new data
    chart.update({
      title: {
        text: data.title
      },
      xAxis: data.xAxis,
      series: data.series
    });
  } else {
    // Create a new chart
    setChart(Highcharts.chart('chart', {
      title: {
        text: data.title
      },
      xAxis: data.xAxis,
      series: data.series
    }));
  }
}, [chart, data]);

return (
  <div id="chart" className="report" />
);
```
By fixing these potential issues, the reports in the React TypeScript application should show the correct data and be rendered correctly.

To change the MirageJS test server to return better data for the reports in the React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard, you can update the server.ts file to define the test data for the "report.ashx" endpoint, like this:

```jsx
import { Server, Model, Factory, faker, schema } from 'miragejs';

export function makeServer() {
  return new Server({
    models: {
      dashboard: Model
    },

    factories: {
      dashboard: Factory.extend({
        title: () => faker.lorem.sentence(),
        buttons: () => [],
        panels: () => []
      })
    },

    routes() {
      this.namespace = 'api';

      this.get('/dashboard.ashx', (schema) => {
        return schema.dashboard.find('1');
      });

      this.get('/report.ashx', (schema, request) => {
        const id = request.queryParams['id'];
        const reportData = {
          '1': {
            title: 'Report 1',
            xAxis: {
              categories: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']
            },
            series: [{
              data: [29.9, 71.5, 106.4, 129.2, 144.0, 176.0, 135.6, 148.5, 216.4, 194.1, 95.6, 54.4]
            }]
          },
          '2': {
            title: 'Report 2',
            xAxis: {
              categories: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']
            },
            series: [{
              data: [216.4, 194.1, 95.6, 54.4, 29.9, 71.5, 106.4, 129.2, 144.0, 176.0, 135.6, 148.5]
            }]
          }
        }

        return response.ok(reportData[id]);
      });
    }
  });
}
```
In this example, the server.ts file defines a makeServer function that creates a new MirageJS test server instance. The test server has a dashboard model and factory, which are used to generate dummy data for the "dashboard.ashx" endpoint. The test server also has two routes: one for the "dashboard.ashx" endpoint, and one for the "report.ashx" endpoint.

For the "report.ashx" endpoint, the server.ts file defines a reportData object, which contains the data for the two reports in the React TypeScript application. When the "report.ashx" endpoint is called, the reportData object is used to return the data for the requested report.

By using this makeServer function, the React TypeScript application will use the MirageJS test server to fetch the data for the dashboard and the reports, and the reports will show the correct data. You can then use this MirageJS test server to test the React TypeScript application without having to make real network requests.

Fix move counters and reports

If the counters and reports in the React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard are not being moved correctly using the react-dnd library, there could be several reasons for this. Here are some possible causes and solutions for this problem:

The react-dnd library is not being used correctly in the components that should be movable. To fix this, you can check the implementation of the Counter and Report components and verify that they are using the react-dnd library correctly.

```jsx
// In the Counter and Report components
const [{ isDragging }, drag] = useDrag({
  item: { type: 'component', id: props.id },
  collect: (monitor) => ({
    isDragging: monitor.isDragging()
  })
});

return (
  <div ref={drag} className="component" style={{ opacity: isDragging ? 0.5 : 1 }}>
    // The content of the Counter or Report component
  </div>
);
```
The Panel component is not using the correct DropTarget and DragSource components provided by the react-dnd library. To fix this, you can check the implementation of the Panel component and verify that it is using the correct DropTarget and DragSource components.

```jsx
// In the Panel component
const [, drop] = useDrop({
  accept: 'component',
  drop: (item, monitor) => {
    props.moveComponent(item.id, props.id);
  }
});

const PanelComponents = DragSource('component', {
  beginDrag: (props) => ({
    id: props.id
  }),
  endDrag: (props, monitor) => {
    const dropResult = monitor.getDropResult();

    if (dropResult && props.id !== dropResult.id) {
      props.moveComponent(props.id, dropResult.id);
    }
  }
}, (connect, monitor) => ({
  connectDragSource: connect.dragSource(),
  isDragging: monitor.isDragging()
}))(PanelComponents);

return (
  <div ref={drop} className="panel">
    <div className="panelTitle">{props.title}</div>
    <div className="panelComponents">
      {props.components.map((component) => (
        <PanelComponents
          key={component.id}
          id={component.id}
          type={component.type}
          value

          ```

By fixing these potential issues, the counters and reports in the React TypeScript application should be movable using the react-dnd library. You can test the movability of the counters and reports by dragging and dropping them between the panels in the application, and verifying that they are being moved correctly.

You can also test the movability of the counters and reports using the MirageJS test server by setting the useFixtures option to true when creating the test server, like this:

```jsx
import { Server, Model, Factory, faker, schema } from 'miragejs';

export function makeServer() {
  return new Server({
    useFixtures: true,

    models: {
      dashboard: Model
    },

    factories: {
      dashboard: Factory.extend({
        title: () => faker.lorem.sentence(),
        buttons: () => [],
        panels: () => []
      })
    },

    fixtures: {
      dashboard: {
        '1': {
          title: 'Dashboard',
          buttons: [
            { id: '1', label: 'Button 1', icon: 'icon1.png' },
            { id: '2', label: 'Button 2', icon: 'icon2.png' },
            { id: '3', label: 'Button 3', icon: 'icon3.png' }
          ],
          panels: [
            {
              id: '1',
              title: 'Panel 1',
              components: [
                { id: '1', type: 'counter', value: 29, subvalue: '€' },
                { id: '2', type: 'report', title: 'Report 1' }
              ]
            },
            {
              id: '2',
              title: 'Panel 2',
              components: [
                { id: '3', type: 'counter', value: 71, subvalue: '€' },
                { id: '4', type: 'report', title: 'Report 2' }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    },

    routes() {
      this.namespace = 'api';

      this.get('/dashboard.ashx', (schema) => {
        return schema.dashboard.find('1');
      });

      this.get('/report.ashx', (schema, request) => {
        const id = request.queryParams['id'];
        const reportData = {
          '1': {
            title: 'Report 1',
            xAxis: {
              categories: ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', '

### My Input to ChatGPT:
Show me the moveComponent function

The moveComponent function is the function that is used to move a component (counter or report) in the React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard. This function is called whenever a component is moved by the user using the react-dnd library.

The moveComponent function is typically defined in the store.ts file, which contains the Zustand store for the application. The store.ts file should look like this:

```jsx
import produce from 'immer';
import { createStore } from 'zustand';

const [useStore] = createStore(() => ({
  dashboard: {
    title: '',
    buttons: [],
    panels: []
  },

  setDashboard: (dashboard) => ({ dashboard }),
  moveComponent: (fromPanelId, toPanelId) =>
    produce((draft) => {
      const fromPanel = draft.dashboard.panels.find((panel) => panel.id === fromPanelId);
      const toPanel = draft.dashboard.panels.find((panel) => panel.id === toPanelId);

      if (!fromPanel || !toPanel) {
        return;
      }

      const component = fromPanel.components.pop();
      toPanel.components.push(component);
    })
}));

export { useStore };
```
In this example, the store.ts file defines a Zustand store using the createStore function. The store has two actions: setDashboard, which is used to set the dashboard data in the store, and moveComponent, which is used to move a component from one panel to another.

The moveComponent action uses the produce function from the immer library to update the state of the store in an immutable way. The moveComponent action finds the source and target panels using the fromPanelId and toPanelId parameters, and then removes the component from the source panel and adds it to the target panel. This action updates the state of the store and causes the React components to re-render, showing the moved component in the target panel.

You can use the useStore hook provided by the Zustand store to access the moveComponent action in the React components, like this:

```jsx
import { useStore } from './store';

const Panel = (props) => {
  const { moveComponent } = useStore();

  return (
    // The Panel component implementation
  );
};
```
In this example, the Panel component uses the useStore hook to access the moveComponent action from the Zustand store. The moveComponent action is then passed down as a prop to the child components that need to call it when a component is moved. The child components can then call the moveComponent action using the props object, like this:

```jsx
const PanelComponents = (props) => {
  const handleMoveComponent = (fromPanelId, toPanelId) => {
    props.moveComponent(fromPanelId, toPanelId);
  };

  return (
    // The PanelComponents implementation
  );
};
```
In this example, the PanelComponents component defines a handleMoveComponent function that calls the moveComponent action from the Zustand store using the `

Fix move component to take itemId 

If the moveComponent function in the React TypeScript application that displays a dashboard is not working correctly because it is not taking the itemId parameter, you can update the implementation of the moveComponent action in the Zustand store to fix this issue.

To fix the moveComponent function, you can update the store.ts file, where the Zustand store is defined, to pass the itemId parameter to the moveComponent action, like this:

```jsx
import produce from 'immer';
import { createStore } from 'zustand';

const [useStore] = createStore(() => ({
  dashboard: {
    title: '',
    buttons: [],
    panels: []
  },

  setDashboard: (dashboard) => ({ dashboard }),
  moveComponent: (itemId, fromPanelId, toPanelId) =>
    produce((draft) => {
      const fromPanel = draft.dashboard.panels.find((panel) => panel.id === fromPanelId);
      const toPanel = draft.dashboard.panels.find((panel) => panel.id === toPanelId);

      if (!fromPanel || !toPanel) {
        return;
      }

      const component = fromPanel.components.find((component) => component.id === itemId);

      if (!component) {
        return;
      }

      fromPanel.components = fromPanel.components.filter((c) => c.id !== itemId);
      toPanel.components.push(component);
    })
}));

export { useStore };
```
In this example, the moveComponent action is updated to accept the itemId parameter, which represents the ID of the component that should be moved. The moveComponent action uses the itemId parameter to find the component in the source panel, and then removes it from the source panel and adds it to the target panel. This updated implementation of the moveComponent action should fix the issue with the moveComponent function not taking the itemId parameter.

To use the updated moveComponent action in the React components, you can update the implementation of the Panel component, where the moveComponent action is called, to pass the itemId parameter to the moveComponent action, like this:

```jsx
const Panel = (props) => {
  const { moveComponent } = useStore();

  const handleMoveComponent = (itemId, fromPanelId, toPanelId) => {
    moveComponent(itemId, fromPanelId, toPanelId);
  };

  return (
    // The Panel component implementation
  );
};
```
In this example, the Panel component defines a handleMoveComponent function that calls the moveComponent action from the Zustand store, and passes the itemId, fromPanelId, and toPanelId parameters to the action. The handleMoveComponent function can then be passed down as a prop to the child components that need to call it when a component is moved, and the child components can call the handleMoveComponent function using the props object, like this:

```jsx
const PanelComponents = (props) => {
  return (
    // The PanelComponents implementation
  );
};
```

      for (const panel of draft.dashboard.panels) {
        const componentIndex = panel.components.findIndex((component) => component.id === itemId);

        if (componentIndex !== -1) {
          fromPanel = panel;
